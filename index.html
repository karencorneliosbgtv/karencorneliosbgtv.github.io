               Scientific studies have shown over and over again that some types of background noise, like those found in an open plan office, can decrease your concentration, which makes it harder for you to process and memorize information. Interruptions by colleagues and constant noise can also cause you stress, resulting in high blood pressure and other unpleasant symptoms. As a result, people are less satisfied with their jobs and experience decreased motivation, leading to a steep decrease in creativity, collaboration, productivity, and an increase in sick leave.

                    "Loud and talkative coworkers can be one of the most annoying distractions on earth — and, unfortunately, they're pretty common in today's workplace," says Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and the author of "Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job." </p>

               <p>When you gotta go, you gotta go.

                    This golden rule of biology, unfortunately, is not always observed by the small-minded managers who run many American workplaces. You’d think that access to a bathroom, and to a place to grab a sustaining bite during a long day, would be a no-brainer.</p>
